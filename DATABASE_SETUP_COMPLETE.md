NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3001"

```

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Test the Application:
1. **Create a new account** to test user registration
2. **Sign in** with demo accounts to explore different dashboards
3. **Test features**:
   - Customer: Apply for loans, view loan details
   - Institution: Create loan products, review applications
   - Admin: Manage users and institutions

### Development:
- The server restarts automatically when you make code changes
- Check the terminal for any errors or warnings
- Access MongoDB data through your MongoDB Atlas dashboard

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you see a 503 error:
- Make sure the development server is running on the correct port
- Check that `.env.local` has the correct `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- Restart the server: `Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`

### If MongoDB connection fails:
- Verify your MongoDB Atlas credentials
- Check your network connection
- Ensure your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas

### If the demo mode banner appears:
- Verify `.env.local` exists and has the correct `MONGODB_URI`
- Restart the development server to pick up changes

## 🎊 Success!

Your **Mankuca Fintech Platform** is now fully configured and connected to MongoDB! The demo mode banner should no longer appear, and all features including user registration, authentication, and data persistence are now fully functional.

Happy coding! 🚀
