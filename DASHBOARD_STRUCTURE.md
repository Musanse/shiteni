# 🎯 Mankuca - Role-Based Dashboard Structure

## 📁 New Project Organization

The project has been reorganized with role-based folder structure for better maintainability and scalability:

```
src/app/dashboard/
├── page.tsx                    # Dashboard router (redirects based on role)
├── layout.tsx                  # Main dashboard layout wrapper
├── customer/                   # Customer-specific dashboard
│   ├── page.tsx               # Customer dashboard
│   └── layout.tsx             # Customer layout
├── institution/                # Institution-specific dashboard
│   ├── page.tsx               # Institution dashboard
│   └── layout.tsx             # Institution layout
└── admin/                      # Admin-specific dashboard
    ├── page.tsx               # Admin dashboard
    └── layout.tsx             # Admin layout
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. **Dashboard Router** (`/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Automatically detects user role from session
- Redirects users to appropriate dashboard:
  - `customer` → `/dashboard/customer`
  - `institution` → `/dashboard/institution`
  - `admin` → `/dashboard/admin`

### 2. **Role-Specific Dashboards**

#### 👤 **Customer Dashboard** (`/dashboard/customer`)
- **Loan Overview**: Active loans, payments, and balances
- **Application Status**: Track loan applications
- **Quick Actions**: Apply for loans, make payments
- **Recent Activity**: Payment history and notifications

#### 🏦 **Institution Dashboard** (`/dashboard/institution`)
- **Application Management**: Review and approve loan applications
- **Loan Products**: Manage available loan products
- **Customer Analytics**: Track customer performance
- **Team Management**: Manage institution staff

#### 🛡️ **Admin Dashboard** (`/dashboard/admin`)
- **Institution Registry**: Approve and manage financial institutions
- **User Management**: Oversee all platform users
- **System Health**: Monitor platform performance
- **Compliance Center**: KYC/AML monitoring

### 3. **Navigation Structure**
Each role has its own navigation menu with relevant features:

**Customer Navigation:**
- Dashboard
- My Loans
- Apply for Loan
- Profile

**Institution Navigation:**
- Dashboard
- Loan Applications
- Loan Products
- Customers
- Analytics
- Team

**Admin Navigation:**
